# Course #2: Let's communicate with Ember

## Goal
The API you've build in course #1 returns default JSON, but that's something Ember can't handle.

Make your API able to return and receive data matching the JSON API specifications.

## Hints
* You need add a new gem called `fast_jsonapi`, created by Netflix

## Rules
* Create a serializer that formats the data
