# Course #3: Calculator with Ember
## Goal
* Create a page with a simple list of calculations and a calculator.
* Build a calculator that looks something like the picture below.
* You can create larger numbers by clicking multiple times on (different) numbers
* The send button creates a new calculation and shows the result afterwards
* The clear button removes the last character of the calculation

## Preparation
* Finish course #1 and course #2 and make sure your Ruby On Rails server is running
* Install all dependencies and run your Ember server

## Hints
* `adapters/application.js`contains the configuration you neeed to communicate with
your API. You don't need any additional configuration.
* Ember has blueprints for creating routes, controllers, components and models.
* The CSS of this calculator is included, so you must be abble to create a look-a-like
of the example. Feel free to create your own CSS.

## Rules
* The layout of the buttons must be the same is in de picture above
* The calculator never shows a result that doesn't match the calcultion.
